# Data Structure Project

## Overview

This project implements various data structures in C++ to demonstrate their functionality and efficiency. The project includes implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Data Structures Implemented

1. **Array**
   - A dynamic array implementation with functions for insertion, deletion, and searching.
   
2. **Linked List**
   - A singly linked list implementation with functions for insertion, deletion, and searching.
   
3. **Stack**
   - A stack implementation using an array with functions for push, pop, and peek.
   
4. **Queue**
   - A queue implementation using a linked list with functions for enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
   
5. **Tree**
   - A binary tree implementation with functions for insertion, deletion, and searching.
   
6. **Graph**
   - A graph implementation using an adjacency matrix with functions for insertion, deletion, and searching.
